# OCD Patient Analytics

The OCD Patient Analytics project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the demographic and clinical profiles of individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). By leveraging SQL and PowerBI, this project analyzes a dataset of 1500 individuals, exploring various aspects such as demographics, clinical information, and symptom severity.

# Background
Motivated by the need to better understand OCD and its impact on different population groups, this project utilizes a rich dataset to answer critical questions about the disorder. The insights gained can help researchers, clinicians, and mental health professionals to improve treatment approaches and patient outcomes.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. Count & Percent of Female vs Male that have OCD & Average Obsession Score by Gender
2. Count of Patients by Ethnicity and their respective Average Obsession Score
3. Number of people diagnosed with OCD Month-over-Month (MoM)
4. What is the most common Obsession Type (Count) & its respective Average Obsession Score
5. What is the most common Compulsion Type (Count) & its respective Average Compulsion Score

# Tools I Used
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract critical insights.
- **PowerBI:** For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Docker:** For containerizing the SQL database.
- **Azure Data Studio:** My preferred tool for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **GitHub:** Crucial for version control and sharing SQL scripts and analyses, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
