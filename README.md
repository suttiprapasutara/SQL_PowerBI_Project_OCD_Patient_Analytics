# The Analysis
### 1. Count & Percent of Female vs Male that have OCD & Average Obsession Score by Gender
Aims to determine the distribution of OCD patients by gender. By calculating the count and percentage of females versus males with OCD, along with the average obsession score for each gender, we can identify potential gender-based differences in OCD prevalence and symptom severity.

```sql
WITH data AS (
SELECT 
    Gender,
    COUNT(Patient_ID) AS patient_count,
    AVG(Y_BOCS_Score_Obsessions) AS avg_obs_score

FROM PortfolioProject..ocd_patient_dataset

GROUP BY 
    Gender

--ORDER BY patient_count
)

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END) AS female_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END) AS male_count,
    
    ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 /
    (SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END) +
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END)) * 100, 2) AS percent_female,
    
    ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 /
    (SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END) +
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN patient_count ELSE 0 END)) * 100, 2) AS percent_male

FROM data;
```

### Key Trends

**1. Balanced Gender Distribution:** 
- The dataset shows a nearly equal distribution of OCD patients by gender, with 747 females (49.8%) and 753 males (50.2%). This indicates that OCD affects males and females almost equally in this sample population.

**2. Slight Male Prevalence:**
- There is a slightly higher percentage of male patients (50.2%) compared to female patients (49.8%). However, the difference is minimal, suggesting that gender is not a significant factor in the prevalence of OCD.

**3. Implications for Treatment:**
- The balanced gender distribution implies that treatment approaches and resources should be equally accessible and tailored to both males and females. Understanding any subtle differences in symptom manifestation or treatment response between genders may be beneficial for clinicians.

### Summary
The analysis reveals a nearly equal distribution of OCD patients between females and males, with 49.8% females and 50.2% males. This suggests that OCD does not significantly favor one gender over the other in terms of prevalence. The slight male predominance is minimal, indicating that both genders are similarly affected by OCD in this dataset. This balanced distribution highlights the importance of ensuring that treatment and support services are equally available to all patients, regardless of gender. Further analysis could explore if there are any differences in the severity or types of OCD symptoms between genders to provide more nuanced insights.

**2. Similar Obsession Scores:**
- The average obsession scores are relatively similar across different ethnic groups, with Asians and Hispanics having an average score of 20, while Africans and Caucasians have an average score of 19. This suggests that the severity of obsession symptoms does not vary significantly between these ethnicities.

**3. Diverse Sample Population:**
- The diverse representation of ethnicities in the dataset highlights the importance of considering cultural and ethnic factors when studying OCD and developing treatment plans. The similarities in average obsession scores across ethnicities suggest that OCD's impact on obsession severity is consistent regardless of ethnic background.

### Summary
The analysis indicates a diverse ethnic representation among OCD patients, with Caucasians (398), Hispanics (392), Asians (386), and Africans (324) making up the sample population. The average obsession scores are relatively uniform across these ethnic groups, ranging from 19 to 20. This uniformity in obsession scores suggests that the severity of obsession symptoms is consistent across different ethnicities, emphasizing the universal nature of OCD. The findings underscore the need for culturally sensitive approaches in OCD research and treatment, ensuring that all ethnic groups receive equitable care and support.
