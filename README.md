# Background
Motivated by the need to better navigate the data scientist job market, this project aims to identify top-paid and in-demand skills, simplifying the job search process for others to find optimal positions.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data scientist?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my in-depth exploration of the data scientist job market, I utilized several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The selected database management system, perfect for handling job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred tool for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control and sharing SQL scripts and analyses, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- **Power BI:** Used for creating data visualizations, such as bar charts, to represent the analysis findings clearly.
